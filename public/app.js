(It's now approaching two million views on YouTube alone.)\n\nFast forward to the summer of 2017, when I heard that a new record was imminent. I don't usually ask an artist back for a second Tiny Desk Concert simply because they have a new release — but for Julien, I had to make an exception. With all the love that surrounded her first visit to the NPR offices, I reached out to ask if she would be willing to do something different this time around. Last fall, she delivered.\n\nAll the songs for her return to the Tiny Desk come from last year's Turn Out The Lights. Just a few weeks before the album's release, she came to Washington; we tuned our piano, she brought violinist Camille Faulkner. The first two songs, \"Hurt Less\" and \"Even,\" were accompanied by Camille, with Julien on piano for the opening tune and acoustic guitar on the second. It's quite stunning, as she sings:\n\nPutting my fist through the plaster in the bathroom of a Motel 6\n\nI must have pictured it all a thousand times\n\nI swear to God I think I'm gonna die\n\nI know you were right\n\nI can't be fixed, so help me\n\nFor the last, Julien put together an arrangement of \"Appointments\" that begins on electric guitar, which then was looped as a backdrop to her on piano and voice.\n\nJulien Baker is a massively talented songwriter with a deeply caring heart and a perfectionist streak — all of which delivered to her a career-making year.

Like, from the universe, saying it wasn’t the end, and that I should keep fighting. But I never got that sign. Must’ve been forever before I realized my guardian angel wasn’t gonna fall from the sky and make him love me again. No amount of false hope or sadness was gonna fix my heart, so when I realized that and finally decided to get up from my spot where I feel like I’d been sitting for days, I kind of just… accepted it. I accepted that the moon stopped following me home and the girl I loved didn’t love me anymore. This wasn’t a fairytale and I wasn’t a kid anymore. It was time to let go. I had to let go. So I did. I let go.\n\nBon Iver\nhttps://boniver.org/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/boniverwi/\nhttps://twitter.com/boniver\n\nSt. Vincent\nhttps://www.facebook.com/St.Vincent\nhttps://twitter.com/st_vincent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/st_vincent/\n\n\nPicture: \nhttps://i.pinimg.com/originals/0f/44/e7/0f44e7f5623d2ac3f297d4c60355977c.jpg\n\nDisclaimer:\nDear artists, producers and photographers!\n\nThe purpose of this upload is to share fantastic music and beautiful pictures!
